# Plan: Site review and improvement report

🎯 任务概述
Review the existing app structure and UX flows based on the current codebase and docs, then propose additions, removals, and modifications to improve efficiency. Produce a report in `docs/` without making code changes.

📋 执行计划
1. Inventory current pages, flows, and interaction patterns from `src/pages` and shared components to understand user journeys.
2. Identify friction points and gaps that affect efficiency (navigation, data management, keyboard flow, visual feedback).
3. Propose feature additions that are low risk and high impact, noting scope and UX rationale.
4. Propose removals or simplifications that reduce clutter or duplicated paths.
5. Draft a concise report in `docs/` summarizing recommendations and expected impact.
6. Confirm no code changes were made and prepare for user approval before any implementation.

⚠️ 风险与注意事项
- Recommendations may be limited by existing state model (localStorage-only); note any constraints explicitly.
- Avoid suggesting changes that would break current data compatibility without migration strategy.
